# Full Stack Lead Management System Progress (12:00 - 17:00)

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### Backend Architecture
- Implemented DDD architecture with clear separation of concerns:
  - Domain Layer: Lead entity and interfaces
  - Infrastructure Layer: DbContext and Repository implementations
  - Application Layer: CQRS queries and handlers

### CQRS Implementation
- Successfully implemented CQRS pattern for read operations [x]
  - GetAcceptedLeadsQuery/Handler
  - GetPendingLeadsQuery/Handler
  - Query dispatcher infrastructure

### Database
- Set up SQLite database (temporary, will migrate to SQL Server)
- Created initial migrations
- Implemented seed data for testing

## Next Steps ðŸš€

### Testing (Priority)
- [ ] Add unit tests for lead endpoints
  - Test GetAcceptedLeadsQuery
  - Test GetPendingLeadsQuery
  - Test Lead status updates and business rules

### Business Logic Implementation
- [ ] Implement Accept Lead endpoint
  - Update status to accepted
  - Apply 10% discount if price > $500
  - Implement email notification system (considering Proxy pattern for email service abstraction)
- [ ] Implement Decline Lead endpoint
  - Update status to declined

### Docker Integration
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for .NET 6 application
- [ ] Set up SQL Server container
- [ ] Create docker-compose for local development

## Technical Assignment Requirements Status

### Prerequisites
- [x] .NET Core 6 API for RESTful service
- [x] SPA (React/Angular)
- [ ] SQL Server (Currently using SQLite)
- [x] ORM (Entity Framework Core)
- [ ] Unit Tests - Next priority

### Advanced Features
- [x] CQRS - Implemented for queries
- [x] DDD Principles - Applied in backend architecture
- [ ] Event Sourcing - Could be added later

### Notes
- Currently using SQLite for rapid development, need to migrate to SQL Server
- Email service implementation pending - considering Proxy pattern for abstraction
- Time spent: 5 hours (12:00 - 17:00)
- Priority is adding unit tests and completing core business logic
